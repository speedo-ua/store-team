            A laptop is an indispensable device for studying, working, playing and other entertainment. Therefore, when choosing, you should carefully study all the characteristics and parameters. It is equally important to choose the right manufacturer. Acer laptops have been leading the market for many years, thanks to high-quality materials, proven technical solutions and durability.

            Model series and advantages of Acer laptops
            In 1986, entrepreneur Stan Shea founded Acer, although it was originally called Multitech International. In 1987, the company was already called Acer and was working on the production of its own chipsets. After that, the popularity of the company reached new heights, thanks to which the corporation became one of the leaders in the electronics market.

            The manufacturer produces office, multimedia and gaming models. They work under the control of Windows and Linux operating systems. It should be noted that Linux is not particularly popular and in demand, so most Acer laptop models are equipped with Windows OS. To protect the processor from overheating and increase the service life, the manufacturer incorporates coolers into the gadget that cool the processor.

            Acer laptops are made in an attractive stylistic solution from quality elements. The company is not afraid to experiment - the model range includes devices with a textured cover and laser engraving. Fingerprints and other contamination are not visible on the devices thanks to the rough surface. The body is made of durable plastic or aluminum. More expensive models are equipped with aluminum cases, but quality assembly is available in all modifications, regardless of cost.

            Some models are made with a removable keyboard and perform the functions of a netbook and a tablet. The colors are mostly standard, black and silver, but some gadgets are made in a bright color scheme.

            The manufacturer pays special attention to the keyboard unit. It manufactures devices with a full-size and ergonomic FineTip keyboard. It is made with a matte coating, which improves tactile sensations, and with hard keys. The touchpad is equipped with a sensitive touch panel and recognizes several simultaneous touches.

            Advantages of Acer laptops:
            Sleek and modern design.
            Affordable and loyal cost.
            A wide range of models.
            High-quality assembly of parts and accessories.
            Capacitive batteries that provide long battery life.
            High-quality sound reproduction.
